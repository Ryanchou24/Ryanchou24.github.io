As a **Machine Learning Engineer Intern** at **Asurion**, I was privileged to work on one of the most cutting-edge applications of AI in customer support. My primary role was leading the integration of **generative AI** into Asurion’s existing support system, aiming to improve the overall efficiency and user experience. Here's a summary of the challenges I faced and the accomplishments that came out of this rewarding experience.

## Improving Customer Support with AI

My team and I worked on incorporating **Autogen** for multi-agent coordination, which allowed the system to handle multiple customer queries in **real-time**. The goal was to ensure that AI could respond to customer issues as quickly and effectively as a human support agent would. I fine-tuned various **LLM models** like **Mistral**, **Llama 3**, and **Falcon** for the task, leading to significant improvements in both latency and accuracy.

> "By optimizing the AI models, we managed to reduce latency by over **10%** and improve the system's ability to resolve customer queries by **15%**."

## Benchmarking for Better Performance

In addition to integration, I worked on benchmarking these models to evaluate their performance rigorously. Using metrics like **BERTScore** and **ROUGE**, we compared the AI’s responses against a large dataset of real-life customer interactions. These insights helped improve the model's overall performance by another **10%** across various real-world scenarios.

## Future of AI at Asurion

This experience opened my eyes to how AI can be used not just to automate tasks but to **enhance customer relationships**. The models we integrated will likely form the backbone of Asurion’s future AI-powered support systems. I’m excited about the future developments in this space and how **AI-driven automation** can continue to create a more personalized and efficient customer experience.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Asurion and look forward to seeing how the advancements we made will shape the future of their AI systems. Working in such a **dynamic environment** with a clear focus on **innovation** gave me invaluable insights into the practical applications of **machine learning**.
