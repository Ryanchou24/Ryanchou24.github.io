My time at TikTok was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to combine my passion for technology, data, and product management. As a Product Manager on the Creator Academy team, I had the unique opportunity to work on projects that directly impacted over 1 million creators on the platform.

From Concept to Launch: Building the Creator Academy

At TikTok, I contributed to the end-to-end design of the TikTok Creator Academy, a space designed to empower creators with educational content and tools. I worked on everything from UX layout to content planning, and even helped with PRD creation to ensure the platform was intuitive and engaging. By enhancing the in-app visibility—through key entry points like the For You Page and Search—we were able to drive a 5% increase in click-through rates for Creator Academy content.

Listening to Creators

One of the most rewarding aspects of my role was engaging directly with the creator community. I led in-depth interviews with creators to gather actionable feedback, which played a key role in shaping the traffic incentive program. This initiative significantly boosted creator satisfaction and made the platform more rewarding for those who dedicate their time and creativity.

	“At TikTok, creators are at the heart of everything we do, and it was a privilege to help improve their journey on the platform.”

Data-Driven Decisions

Being a product manager at TikTok required a deep dive into data. Through a competitive analysis of five major platforms, I helped define the positioning of the Creator Center, leading to the development of the Creator Wiki. This resource seamlessly integrated into the existing Creator Academy and provided even more valuable content to help creators succeed.

My experience at TikTok taught me the importance of user feedback and data in shaping a product that resonates with its audience. I’m excited to continue applying these lessons to future projects.
